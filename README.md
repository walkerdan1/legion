## Documentation

This repository is a part of the Legion VFX pipeline.

It primarily consists of software extensions [scripts, plugins, configurations] of software that is locally installed on the end users computer or on a shared server. Locally installed software examples would be:

* Nuke
* Maya
* Photoshop
* RV
* Deadline
* Shotgun Desktop

Currently, a shared server does not exist so we'll be developing to accommodate a local installation. 

The Asset Management software utilized is driven by Shotgun and Shotgun Toolkit with hooks into most software applications mentioned above with support for others not mentioned.

For more information about this pipeline and for release notes, see the wiki section.
